# Deep Learning Edge Detection Models

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Edge Detection Models** repository! 🚀 This is a personal project where I'm developing deep learning-based edge detectors that not only predict the existence of edges but also classify their types. 

## 🧐 What’s Inside?

### 🔹 The Models
I’ve built **three** different models, each trained on a different matrix size:
- **3×3 matrix-based model**
- **5×5 matrix-based model**
- **7×7 matrix-based model**

Each model learns to detect edges and classify them into **16 different edge types**. You can check out the defined edge types in `Training.ipynb`.

### 📊 Training Data
- The training datasets are **randomly generated**.
- You can generate them yourself by running the `Training.ipynb` files.

### 🖼️ Testing on Real Images
- The `Real_Images.ipynb` notebook tests the models on **real-world images**.
- I compare the results with well-known edge detectors like **Sobel** and **Canny**, as well as **human-annotated ground truth**.
- Sample images and ground truth annotations can be found in the `images/` folder.

## ✨ What Makes This Unique?
Unlike conventional edge detectors, my models predict **both**:
1. **The existence of an edge**
2. **The type of edge** (from the predefined 16 edge types)

## 🚧 Development Status
This project is still a **work in progress**, so I’d love to hear **suggestions, improvements, and feedback!** 😊 If you have ideas, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

## 📜 License
TBD (I'm still figuring this part out—stay tuned!).
